# Research Journal Template
By **Níckolas de Aguiar Alves**

For a while now I have kept a research journal to keep track of my progress in my MSc, which papers and books I checked, and so on. The idea is mainly to have a document with simple entries that can later help me when writing reports or when trying to remember a reference I checked months ago. Recently I've decided to update my template and make it available online. This is it.
